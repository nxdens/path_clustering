# path clustering
This project uses Scikit learn in python to cluster a set of segemented vein canidates in SWI images. The goal is to find which clusters of veins serve as good canidates for segementation. 

Currently the segmented veins are from a small slice of the brain but eventually will contain the entire brain. 

This work is preliminary to eventually perform automatic segmentation.
